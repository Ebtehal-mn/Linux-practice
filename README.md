# Linux-practice
I just finished a Linux course, and this is my practice on how to create a bash script.
It simply creates a user and checks if the group exists or needs to create a new one.

Instructions: 
after downloading the file just call it by
sh addingUser.sh

to edit the script write
nano addingUser.sh
